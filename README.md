This software simulates the medical residency match. It does so by spawning 10 randomly generated specialties, and for each specialty it generates 10 programs. Each specialty has a typical number of spots per program, which is randomly assigned a value between 1 and 50. The number of applicants is forced to equal the number of program spots. 

## Getting Started

The main script is `residency_match.py`. Download the repository and run the computations using python3.6 via a terminal.

### Prerequisites

You can install the prerequisite packages with pip

### Installing

Clone the repo then install the prerequisites.

```
git clone https://github.com/pySRURGS/residency_match.git
cd residency_match
pip install -r requirements.txt --user
```

### Running the Simulations

You can run a quick run of the entire process by running `python3 test.py`, which executes the entire process with only 10 repetitions per set. Windows users can run `test.sh` instead of `test.py`, since the `sh` module is only available on Linux. The figure is generated in `figure.png` and the statistics spreadsheet is generated in `stats.csv`.
