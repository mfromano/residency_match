This software simulates the medical residency match. It does so by spawning 10 randomly generated specialties, and for each specialty it generates 10 programs. Each specialty has a typical number of spots per program, which is randomly assigned a value between 1 and 50. The number of applicants is forced to equal the number of program spots.
